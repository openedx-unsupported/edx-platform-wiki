Note: before attempting to debug Open edX, you should follow these steps to run the LMS and Studio outside of the debugger: 

[https://github.com/edx/configuration/wiki/edX-Developer-Stack](https://github.com/edx/configuration/wiki/edX-Developer-Stack)

PyCharm will only run the Python processes for you, and so doesn't do all of the initialization to compile SASS files etc.

### Debugging the devstack image with PyCharm professional edition

Debugging with devstack is more complex than in a direct local development environment, as the source code lives on your local machine but the code is executing within the Vagrant image. One solution is to use [PyCharm Professional Edition](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) from JetBrains. It is able to debug devstack using its concept of [remote Python interpreters](http://blog.jetbrains.com/pycharm/2013/03/how-pycharm-helps-you-with-remote-development/). Similar setups should also work for any IDE which supports a remote interpreter.

Here are the steps to use PyCharm on MacOS (other Unix environments should be similar). Note that PyCharm will start up a new instance of the process you wish to debug. Connecting a debugger to a pre-existing Python process is more involved and is not documented here. For more information, see [PyCharm's remote debugger documentation](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/webhelp/remote-debugging.html).

* First, start up a terminal and give the 'edxapp' user a password
```
  vagrant ssh
  sudo passwd edxapp
  [type in a password of your choice]
```
* Create a PyCharm project for devstack (if you don't have one already):
  * Select "New Project..." from the "File" menu
  * Choose "Pure Python" for "Project type" (note: don't choose "Django project" as that can't currently be interpreted remotely)
  * Select your devstack folder as the "Location" (or if your source code is not located under the devstack directory, select the parent folder of your source code)
  * Say "Yes" to the question about using existing sources for the project
* To make PyCharm's editor traverse imports in edx-platform python modules, go to "PyCharm > Preferences > Project: devstack > Project Structure" and mark the following directories as "Source Folders":
  * cms/djangoapps
  * cms/lib
  * common/djangoapps
  * common/lib
  * lms/djangoapps
  * lms/lib
  * openedx
  * common/lib/xmodule (NOTE: in theory this shouldn't be needed, but it seems to be necessary with PyCharm 5)
* You can also mark the following symlinks to be "Excluded" so that PyCharm doesn't see multiple copies of the same files:
  * cms/static/xmodule_js
  * lms/static/xmodule_js
  * lms/static/templates
* You might also want to hide the translations directory as every language matches when you search for a product string:
  * conf/locale

### Create a PyCharm remote interpreter (PyCharm v3.4+)
* Select  "ï£¿ > Preferences"
* Select "Project Interpreter" under "Project Settings"
* Click the gear icon in the upper right corner of the dialog box
* In the drop down that appears, click on "Add Remote"
* Select the "SSH Credentials" radio button. If you have trouble getting SSH credentials to work, you can instead use "Key pair (OpenSSH)" and specify the location of your private key file ```(/Users/your_user_name/.ssh/id_rsa)```. This may be necessary with newer versions of MacOS. In this case you will need to append your public key (```/Users/your_user_name/.ssh/id_rsa.pub```) to the ```~edxapp/.ssh/authorized_keys2``` file on your vm, which you may need to create.
* Directions for "SSH Credentials". Specify the following configurations:
 * Host: ```127.0.0.1```
 * Port: ```2222```
 * User name: ```edxapp```
 * Auth type: ```password```
 * Password: the password you specified (ensure that "Save Password" is selected)
 * Python interpreter path: ```/edx/app/edxapp/venvs/edxapp/bin/python```
 * The end result should look like this:
***

![PyCharm 3.4+ conf](https://1786529bf2dfcc9a4fc2736524bc8aea4a66cc50.googledrive.com/host/0BxQlaq542xl2V182QTM4ZF9kZlU/pycharm_remote_conf.png)
* PyCharm will automatically detect the helper folder and upload the debugging files. The final configuration should look like this:
![PyCharm 3.4+ conf] (https://1786529bf2dfcc9a4fc2736524bc8aea4a66cc50.googledrive.com/host/0BxQlaq542xl2V182QTM4ZF9kZlU/pycharm_conf.jpg)

### Create Debug Configuration for LMS
After the PyCharm remote interpreter is configured we are ready to debug devstack.

* Create a debug configuration for LMS server
  * Open the file 'edx-platform/manage.py' in your devstack folder
  * Right-click on the file and choose "Create 'manage'..." to create a debug configuration
  * Specify the settings for the new configuration:
    * Change the name to something more memorable, e.g. "LMS".
    * Specify "./manage.py" for "Script".
    * Specify "lms runserver --settings=devstack 0.0.0.0:8000" for "Script parameters".    
    * Choose the remote interpreter (usually named as "Remote Python 2.7.3 (ssh://edxapp.127.0.0.1:2222/...)").
    * Specify "/edx/app/edxapp/edx-platform" for "Working directory".
    * Click to edit the "Path mappings" property
      * Click the "+" button to add a new mapping
      * Specify the full local path to "edx-platform" for "Local path". This should be the edx-platform directly beneath your devstack folder, e.g. "/Users/[username]/devstack/edx-platform/". Note: be sure to include a trailing slash, and don't use the '~' syntax for your home directory. You have to enter two trailing slashes when you're typing the path in the input field in order for the trailing slash to be preserved.
      * Specify "/edx/app/edxapp/edx-platform/" for "Remote path".
      * Click "OK" to save the mappings.
    * Deselect "Add content roots to PYTHONPATH".
    * Deselect "Add source roots to PYTHONPATH".
  * Click "OK" to save the new debug configuration.
  * Your LMS server configuration should look something similar to:
![LMS server configuration]
(https://1786529bf2dfcc9a4fc2736524bc8aea4a66cc50.googledrive.com/host/0BxQlaq542xl2V182QTM4ZF9kZlU/LMS_server.png)

* Debug the new "LMS" configuration. Note that this will start up a new LMS instance on port 8000, so ensure that you are not already running the LMS.
  * Choose "Run > Debug..."
  * Specify "LMS" and the Django instance should be started up.
  * Try the following to ensure that you can set breakpoints:
    * Open the file lms/envs/common.py
    * Put a breakpoint on the first line (```PLATFORM_NAME = "Your Platform Name Here"```)
    * Visit http://localhost:8000/ and verify that PyCharm stops at the breakpoint
  * **Note on relative paths** If you choose to optionally create symlinks, make sure to specify the full paths, otherwise PyCharm will not recognize the source files. This leads to a "Source File Does Not Exist" error when trying to debug.

### Create a debug configuration for Studio (CMS) 
* The Studio configuration is very similar to LMS, so we need to clone the LMS configuration and adjust a few parameters. 
  * Choose "Run > Edit Configurations..."
  * Select "LMS"
  * Click the "Copy configuration" button (next to the "-" button)
  * Change the name to "Studio"
  * Change the "Script parameters" to ```cms runserver --settings=devstack 0.0.0.0:8001```
  * Click "OK" to save the new configuration

### Testing your changes

See the [[Test Engineering FAQ]] for all your questions about testing the edX platform.

### Debugging edX platform tests in PyCharm

Now with the remote interpreter, we can use PyCharm to debug edX platform tests (Python, JavaScript, Bok Choy, Acceptance). Note: PyCharm tests are invoked using ```paver``` but unfortunately this creates child processes that cannot be debugged. For this reason, it is necessary to execute the child process directly.

### Create a test configuration for an individual LMS test

* As before, we need to clone the LMS configuration and adjust a few parameters. In this case, we are going to run ```test_views.py```.
  * Choose "Run > Edit Configurations..."
  * Select "LMS"
  * Click the "Copy configuration" button (next to the "-" button)
  * Change the name to "LMS Tests"
  * Change the "Script parameters" to ```lms --settings test test lms/djangoapps/courseware/tests/test_views.py```
  * Click "OK" to save the new configuration

### Setting up Bokchoy Test Configuration (can't catch breakpoints)
![Bokchoy Test Configuration]
(https://1786529bf2dfcc9a4fc2736524bc8aea4a66cc50.googledrive.com/host/0BxQlaq542xl2V182QTM4ZF9kZlU/bokchoy_server.png)
* Go to Run -> Edit Configurations -> Add New Configuration (usually a +sign on the left).
* Script: ```/edx/app/edxapp/venvs/edxapp/bin/paver```.
* Script parameters: ```test_bokchoy``` or ```test_bokchoy --fasttest``` (if you have already compiled the assets). 
* Choose the remote interpreter (usually named as "Remote Python 2.7.3 (ssh://edxapp.127.0.0.1:2222/...)").
* Working directory: ```/Users/[username]/devstack/edx-platform```
* Path mappings: ```/Users/[username]/devstack/edx-platform=/edx/app/edxapp/edx-platform```

### Setting up Bokchoy Test Configuration for catching break points
The idea is to start up all the services that will listen on various ports and then run tests individually while those services are up. It is useful to install the [Multirun](http://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7248?pr=pycharm) tool (you can install it directly within the IDE under preferences -> plugins -> Browse repositories ); this way you can have one-click deployment of all of these services.

**1.  In Preferences/ Project Structure mark ./common/djangoapps/terrain/stubs as a source.**
* **Make sure that https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/Setting-up-PyCharm-for-edX-development#integrate-xquartz-into-pycharm is working and to remember the DISPLAY variable.  (in the terminal you can do ```echo $DISPLAY``` and make sure that is non-null**

### Visually debug your tests with XQuartz
You can setup your development environment such that you can visually interact with browsers and other GUIs in the vagrant machine from the host machine. To do this, you will need to install [XQuartz](http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/). For further information, see [Test Engineering FAQ](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/Test-engineering-FAQ#im-working-with-devstack-and-want-to-debug-the-jasmine-or-acceptance-tests-in-the-browser-on-my-host-system-how-do-i-do-that).

### Integrate XQuartz into PyCharm
The following instructions are for Mac OS X but should work on any Unix-like environment.
* First, we need to enable XQuartz forwarding for all ssh agents. To do this, open ```/etc/ssh_config``` on your host system and uncomment ```ForwardX11 no``` and change to ```ForwardX11 yes```.
* Next open a terminal **inside** PyCharm (Tools -> at bottom-left corner - ![](https://www.jetbrains.com/img/webhelp/idea/show_hide_tool_window_bars.png) -> Terminal) and type ```ssh edxapp@127.0.0.1 -p 2222```. After logging in as edxapp user, try to open Firefox by typing ```firefox``` into the terminal. XQuartz should fire up Firefox immediately. Keep this terminal **open**, DO NOT close it.
* Now we need to get the display port number from this terminal by ```echo $DISPLAY```. This depends on the number of existing ssh terminals. If this it the only one, it will be ```localhost:10.0```.
* Open a debug configuration (such as Bokchoy) and add DISPLAY to the environment variable with the port number from the previous step. The string ```DISPLAY=localhost:10.0``` should be inside the environment variable string.
![Display Port Environmental Variable]
(https://1786529bf2dfcc9a4fc2736524bc8aea4a66cc50.googledrive.com/host/0BxQlaq542xl2V182QTM4ZF9kZlU/display_port.png)
* Now we can start debugging Paver tests with browser windows popping up in XQuartz.
* Note: the port number (10.0, 11.0, etc, ...) changes dynamically with the number of open ssh clients. Therefore, you have to open and keep the ssh terminal inside Pycharm all the time.
* If the PyCharm debugger does not attach itself to the thread for some reasons, you can insert the break point manually:

```
from nose.tools import set_trace
set_trace()
```

Note - 
If you somehow `vagrant destroy` the vagrant instance and reinstall it, then follow these steps to restore proper communication between Vagrant and Pycharm-
* Set new `passwd` for `edxapp`, and create directory `.pycharm_helpers` (Follow steps given above)
* There are a lot of chances that you might face `Database Error` in unexpected places (Events). To avoid this; run following command-
```
paver update_db -s devstack
```
* You may have to update static assets too. To do that, run following command-
```
paver update_assets
```
