A growing tradition at edX is having internal hackathons. There are lots of reasons we want to do hackathons, three of which are:

  * we would get to learn about parts of the codebase that we rarely touch (for example, I know next to nothing about Studio/course authoring, and would love to contribute while learning a bit)
  * there are some code issues that need to be fixed, but don't really fall into the typical daily work schedule and could benefit from a hackathon format where people from different teams can work together
  * there are a lot of potentially useful/cool new features that our engineers haven't been able to demonstrate, so let's get them out there!

We've had three hackathons so far and are hosting our first broader community hackathon!
