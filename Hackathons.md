A growing tradition at edX is having internal hackathons. The goal of these two day hackathons is in three primary areas:

  * We would get to learn about parts of the codebase that we rarely touch (for example, I know next to nothing about Studio/course authoring, and would love to contribute while learning a bit)
  * There are some code issues that need to be fixed, but don't really fall into the typical daily work schedule and could benefit from a hackathon format where people from different teams can work together
  * There are a lot of potentially useful/cool new features that our engineers haven't been able to demonstrate, so let's get them out there!

We've had three hackathons so far, are hosting our first broader community hackathon.
