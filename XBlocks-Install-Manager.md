Ideas for improving ways of installing and managing XBlocks.

* Platform developer support
  * Easily add an external XBlock to a course
* XBlock developer
  * Provide a repository of XBlocks that can be consumed 
* Course developer support
* Studio administrator
  * Register one or more known XBlocks
  * See a list of all XBlocks installed into Studio
  * Determine if newer versions are available and install them

UX ideas
* Implement a 'list of XBlocks' UI
  * Base this upon the pageable assets UI in Studio
  * Each XBlock could optionally provide a thumbnail for itself
  * Could show a grid of thumbnails instead of a row

Tools to look at
* Chrome extensions
* Firefox add-ons
* Eclipse plugins
* Apple App Store

Future directions
* Provide a plugin framework for all aspects of edX tooling (not everything can be an XBlock)
  * Custom reports
  * Custom import/export tools
  * Custom administrative scripts
