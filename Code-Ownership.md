Although we all share responsibility for improving the codebase as a whole, some people know parts of the codebase better than others. This table maps conceptual pieces of the codebase to people who "own" them, or have the most knowledge and expertise around that concept. When changing parts of the codebase that you are unfamiliar with (which happens fairly frequently!) please check this page any notify anyone who "owns" a piece of the codebase that you are modifying.
