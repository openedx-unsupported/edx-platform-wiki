# The "Community" Edition
During this hackathon we are lucky to have some external friends and family at edX HQ. The best way to make friends is to hack on projects, so that's just what we're doing. We count among our friends this time:
* Part of the Stanford team
* Others!

# The Hacks

* [Diff Cover](https://github.com/edx/diff-cover) hacks
  - [Diff Quality](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/Diff-Quality)
* Adding [[In-Progress Grades]] and testing the grades system
* Prototype [[Courseware Traversal Visualization]]
* [Jenkins Ansible provisioning] (https://github.com/edx/configuration/tree/will/jenkins)
* Cleaning: a [hack](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/pull/355) [in](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/pull/352) [four](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/pull/347) [parts](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/pull/353)
* [[Online Python Tutor integration into edX]]

# Why this would be useful
* Learn about parts of the codebase that we rarely touch
* Work with people we don't get to normally
* Want to get something done outside of the sprint
* Brainstorming and prototyping new features

# The Schedule
1. July 8, 2013: *hack*
2. July 9, 2013: *demo* (3:30-5pm) ([Google Hangout](https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/calendar/bWNoYW5nQGVkeC5vcmc.6pftm7tku5r4v8d8ofn8udukjo))

# The Proposed Hacks

| Advocate | Description | Interested Parties |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|
| @markchang | facebook-style stickers in the forums | |
| @Slater-Victoroff | extensible library for fuzz tests | |
| @sarina | emoji in the forums | @lapentab |
| @wedaly | New features for [diff-cover](https://github.com/edx/diff-cover): show original source lines in the HTML report, CSS styling of reports, combine multiple coverage XML inputs, show pep8/pylint violations, plug-in architecture using [stevadore](http://stevedore.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).  Any help much appreciated :) | @pbaratta |
| @pg | integrate [pythontutor.com](http://pythontutor.com/) into edX platform (useful for CS courses) | @rocha |
| @natea | edX on [Docker](http://docker.io). Some work was already done on this at the last hackathon by Cale. See his [summary](https://edx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ENG/How+we+deal+with+tons+of+services+on+setup+with+Docker), so this would be to continue that work. | |
| @csvoss | On the progress page, display a projected grade for only the sections attempted so far. [pull request](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/pull/359) | @felixsun, @csvoss |
| @marcotuts| concept sketches,clickable walkthrough, plus (?) for learner analytics redesign | 
| @mlsteele, @rlucioni| Courseware traversal visualization | 
| @jarv | installing edX on Google ComputeEngine |
