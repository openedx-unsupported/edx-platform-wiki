# The "Community" Edition
During this hackathon we are lucky to have some external friends and family at edX HQ. The best way to make friends is to hack on projects, so that's just what we're doing. We count among our friends this time:
* Part of the Stanford team
* ...

# Why this would be useful
* Learn about parts of the codebase that we rarely touch
* Work with people we don't get to normally
* Want to get something done outside of the sprint
* Brainstorming and prototyping new features

# The Schedule
1. July 8, 2013: *hack*
2. July 9, 2013: *demo* (3:30-5pm) (will insert Google Hangout link here)

# The Proposed Hacks

| Advocate | Description | Interested Parties |
|----------|-------------|--------------------|
| @markchang | facebook-style stickers in the forums | |
| @Slater-Victoroff | extensible library for fuzz tests | |
| @sarina | emoji in the forums | |
| @wedaly | New features for [diff-cover](https://github.com/edx/diff-cover): show original source lines in the HTML report, CSS styling of reports, combine multiple coverage XML inputs, show pep8/pylint violations, plug-in architecture using [stevadore](http://stevedore.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).  Any help much appreciated :) | |
| @pg | integrate [pythontutor.com](http://pythontutor.com/) into platform and forums for CS courses (since lots of students are already informally using it for 6.00x) | |
| @natea | edX on [Docker](http://docker.io). Some work was already done on this at the last hackathon by Cale. See his [summary](https://edx-wiki.atlassian.net/wiki/display/ENG/How+we+deal+with+tons+of+services+on+setup+with+Docker), so this would be to continue that work. | |
| @pgbovine| Integrate pythontutor into the edX platform | @rocha |
| @cvoss | As a student browsing edX courses [here](https://www.edx.org/course-list/allschools/allsubjects/allcourses), it's hard to quickly skim through the titles of all available courses. Adding a "summary" link, to see a page like the one found [here](http://www.class-central.com/initiative/edx), could be helpful.
