# edX RESTful API
The edX API is designed to allow clients to introspect and manipulate XBlocks and
their related models.

![index/snapshot overview](https://s3.amazonaws.com/uploads.hipchat.com/26537/313915/C41Suikkfgpl4PG/api.png)

# Group XBlocks
Conceptually, an XBlock is any component that knows how to render itself, at least
in a certain context. XBlocks can contain other XBlocks. XBlocks can define their
own schema for storing data, which must consist only of primitive types
(string, int, list, mapping)

*Note:* This API is read-only. XBlock types cannot be created, modified, or deleted
through this API; available XBlock types are solely controlled by the server
administrator(s). Other XBlock types may exist on other servers, but these API
responses will only contain information about the XBlock types that this server
supports.

## XBlock Type Collection [/v1/xblock_types]
### Read [GET]
+ Response 200 (application/json)

        [{
          "id": "thumbs",
          "title": "Thumbs",
          "description": "a simple control to indicate thumbs-up or thumbs-down, and aggregate responses",
          "schema": {},
        }, {
          "id": "randomize",
          "title": "Randomize",
          "description": "randomize children",
          "schema": {}
        }, {
          "id": "schema_ex",
          "title": "Schema Type Example",
          "description": "just demonstrates all the different schema types",
          "schema": {
            "name": "string",
            "age": "int",
            "my_dict": {
                "a": "string"
            },
            "list_of_strings": ["string"],
            "list_of_ints": ["int"]
          }
        }]

@ormsbee: Why are we exposing the XBlock Type's schema?

@ormsbee: Will XBlock Types have versions? Authors?

@ormsbee: What is the use case for this? Studio querying to see what XBlock types are available for authoring? If so, does it need any additional information about how to categorize them?

## XBlock Type Detail [/v1/xblock_types/{id}]
+ Parameters
    + id (required, string, `schema_ex`)
        The ID of the XBlock type; usually a short lowercase string.

### Read [GET]
+ Response 200 (application/json)

        {
          "id": "schema_ex",
          "title": "Schema Type Example",
          "description": "just demonstrates all the different schema types",
          "schema": {
            "name": "string",
            "age": "int",
            "my_dict": {
                "a": "string"
            },
            "list_of_strings": ["string"],
            "list_of_ints": ["int"]
          }
        }
        


@ormsbee: Since this is the exact same information as what's in the listing, why would someone want to use this? Wouldn't they typically come through the list view to get here?

@ormsbee: I'm not sure if this is within the scope of the API, but once I'm at a detail view for an XBlock type, what can I do with this information? Is there a resource that can be linked off of here that would bring me to something where I could create a new content piece based off of this XBlock type? See its editor? A sample problem?

# Group Indexes
Conceptually, an index is simply a mapping of branches
(such as "live", "draft", "honors", etc) to the latest snapshot
for that branch. Indexes also contain permission information
for who can read the index, and who can modify its contents
(or the contents of its child snapshots).

A Course is the definitive example of an index, but other
types of indexes could also exist.

## Indexes by Organization [/v1/indexes?qualifier={partial_id}]
Returns a qualified list of indexes as specified by a partial ID. This allows
API clients to filter API responses based on organization, department, etc.
This is a simple string prefix match, but the match must be followed either
by a dot or by the end of the string. For example, if the `partial_id` is "mit.eecs",
then "mit.eecs.7001X" and "mit.eecs.8910X.Dec2014" would match, but
"mit.eecs7001X" would not match, nor would "harvard.mit.eecs"
+ Parameters
    + partial_id (optional, string, `myu.compsci`)

## Index Details [/v1/indexes/{id}]
+ Parameters
    + id (required, locator string, `arizona.latin.spring-2014`)

### Create [POST]
Create a new index with the information provided. An index can only
be created at the given ID if the user sending the API request has
permission to administer the fully-qualified identifier. For example,
a user could not create a course under the `mit` namespace unless
the user has permission to modify that namespace. New namespaces
can be arbitrarily created by anyone.

The "id" parameter in the request is optional; if specified, it
must match the id in the URL for this request.
The "branches" and "permissions" maps are both optional.
If the "branches" is not included in the request; it will
be populated by the server with one branch named "draft". If the
"permissions" map is not included in the request, the default
permissions are read and write access for the user that created
the index, and no other permissions for anyone.

### Delete [DELETE]
Note that a DELETE request to an index will not change its `status`
attribute to "deleted" -- it will really, truly delete the index.
Subsequent GET requests to the index's former ID will return an
HTTP 404 status code. To update the `status` attribute, use a PUT
request to partially update the index.

# Group Snapshots
A snapshot provides a versioned dictionary of all blocks directly included in a
courseware subtree with their settings, children references, and edit info.
It also includes pointers to the parent snapshot, the ancestor snapshot,
the index that owns it, the user who created this snapshot.

Snapshots are immutable -- any operation to "modify" an existing snapshot
will create a new snapshot instead. When a snapshot is created, it copies
the permissions mapping from the index that owns it at the moment of its
creation. Indexes may have their permissions change, but the permissions
on a particular snapshot are set at its creation and may never change.

## Snapshot [/v1/snapshots/{id}]
+ Parameters
    + id (required, UUID, `5884ec28-f2a8-4735-a9f9-d54158405af5`)

            "name": "Chapter Three",
            "children": []
          }
        }

## XBlock Instance [/v1/snapshots/{id}/xblocks/{name}]
Like snapshots, XBlock instances are immutable. Any operation that would
modify an existing XBlock instance instead creates a new instance, and
returns a reference to that newly-created instance.

+ Parameters
    + id (required, UUID, `a7e3233a-c19d-40d4-b450-2046bd099501`)
        The ID of the snapshot that contains this xblock, usually a UUID.
    + name (required, string, `chapter7`)
        The name of the xblock instance contained in the snapshot

### Read [GET]
Note that the `id` and `parent` fields are IDs and not URLs, even though they
may resemble URLs. That's why they do not start with `/v1`.

+ Response 200 (application/json)
        
        {
          "id": "/snapshots/a7e3233a-c19d-40d4-b450-2046bd099501/xblocks/chapter7",
          "type": "schema_ex",
          "parent": "/snapshots/e78ff15e-da0b-4d77-845e-30a30d265106/xblocks/chapter7",
          "children": [],
          "name": "my_name",
          "age": 30,
          "my_dict": {
            "a": "b"
          },
          "list_of_strings": ["foo", "bar", "baz"],
          "list_of_ints": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        }

### Create new XBlock instance based on partially updating this instance [PUT]
Note that this will create a new snapshot based on this snapshot, and a new
XBlock instance based on this XBlock instance. The response is simply a
pointer to the newly-created XBlock instance under the newly-created snapshot.

+ Request (application/json)
            
        {"name": "a_different_name"}

+ Response 201 (application/json)
    + Headers
        
            Location: /v1/snapshots/b6bbab4a-3a21-485e-ab41-094488ae0847/xblocks/chapter7

    + Body

              "message": "created",
              "location": "/v1/snapshots/b6bbab4a-3a21-485e-ab41-094488ae0847/xblocks/chapter7"
            }

## Subset of XBlock Instance Fields [/v1/snapshots/{id}/xblocks/{name}?fields={field_list}]
An XBlock instance can contain a lot of information. To reduce the size
of the response, a client can specify that it is only interested in a subset
of the fields in the XBlock instance. The API response will then only return
those fields.

+ Parameters
    + id (required, UUID, `a7e3233a-c19d-40d4-b450-2046bd099501`)
        The ID of the snapshot that contains this xblock, usually a UUID.
    + name (required, string, `chapter7`)
        The name of the xblock instance contained in the snapshot
    + field_list (optional, comma-separated list of strings, `name,age`)
        A comma-separated list of field names to include in the response
        to this request. If the `field_list` attribute is specified,
        any fields not included in the `field_list` will not be included
        in the response.
