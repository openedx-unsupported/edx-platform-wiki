For [[Hackathon 4|Hackathon four: the more the merrier]] Miles Steele abd Renzo Lucioni prototyped a method of visualizing student paths through courseware. We came up with this interactive graph displaying randomly generated data.

In this colored graph, the thickness of each line represents how many students followed the path indicated by that line. Mousing over a line will make it black and more opaque.

In this grayscale graph, each line represents the path of a single student. Mousing over a line will make it red and more opaque.

Neither of these graphs have an explicit horizontal axis. What appears to be a horizontal axis is composed of student paths which visit each component of the courseware in order.
