## Goal: 
Support only a few use cases with only a little bit of functionality at the start, to get something that can be implemented quickly, and still be of some value.

## Stories: 

1. As in instructor, I want to invite students enrolled in a MOOC to join my private class, so that I can see their usage data from the MOOC, with their permission.

1. As a student, I want to join a small class within a MOOC, based on an instructor's invitation.  By doing so, I'm agreeing to share my usage data with the instructor.  I also want to see how my data compares with others in this class.  I can join more than one class if I wish.

1. As a student, I want to set up a study group, inviting other students.  I won't be able to see their individual data, but we'll each be able to see how our own data compares to the aggregate for the group.
