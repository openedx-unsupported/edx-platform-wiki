Christina| Improvement to Advanced Settings page in Studio | Display names, help, hide "deprecated" fields, possibly validation
JZ      | Create a rules-based risk calculation for PRs | I got started with this [here](https://github.com/jzoldak/gh-pr-risk)
Ned     | Coverage measurement of Django templates | Last time was Mako, let's try Django.

Steve   | Group Project Assessments | Allow a group of students to collaborate on a single project, submit it for review, then grade peer groups |
AndyA | [[XBlock Admin Views|xblock-admin-views]] | Support global/course-scoped admin pages for xblocks (for Studio, but would love help with Instructor Dashboard integration) |
