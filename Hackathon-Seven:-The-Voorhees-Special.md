# Hackathon Ideas

Name(s) | Idea        | Notes
--------|-------------|-------
DB      | Django 1.6! | It's a crazy idea. But I want to give it a shot. ([the work begins here](https://github.com/edx/xblock-sdk/pull/10))
Christina| Improvement to Advanced Settings page in Studio | Display names, help, hide "deprecated" fields, possibly validation
JZ      | Create a rules-based risk calculation for PRs | I got started with this [here](https://github.com/jzoldak/gh-pr-risk)
Ned     | Coverage measurement of Django templates | Last time was Mako, let's try Django.
Will    | Mobile study groups app  |  |
Steve   | Group Project Assessments | Allow a group of students to collaborate on a single project, submit it for review, then grade peer groups |
AndyA | [[XBlock Admin Views|xblock-admin-views]] | Support global/course-scoped admin pages for xblocks (for Studio, but would love help with Instructor Dashboard integration) |
Gabe | Hive Data Pipeline | Load all event data (and maybe some other sources) in to hive tables to experiment with and run adhoc queries against. |
Jarv | Packages for open-edx installations | Install edX without having to go out to pypi, github, with a package for every role. How about `apt-get install edx`?
