Just wanted to post a few of the tools I've been using to debug issues that I've found helpful.

RabbitMQ google group and the mongodb docs pages have been useful as well.

If you've used a tool that's helped you to understand, troubleshoot or install, please add to the list.

### Windows Tools

### Linux Tools

### Mac OS Tools
* [MongoHub](http://code.google.com/p/mongohub/)
* [MySQL GUI Tools](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/gui-tools/5.0.html)
* SequelPro

You'll need to configure mongodb and mysql to accept external connections, or alternatively set up a SSH tunnel.

## Web-based tools
* [RockMongo](http://rockmongo.com/)
* [phpMyAdmin](http://www.phpmyadmin.net/)
* [JSON Editor Online](http://www.jsoneditoronline.org/)

You can install a separate apache instance or use the nginx that comes with EdX.  I've found a separate apache was easier and keeps you from modifying your EdX components unnecessarily.
