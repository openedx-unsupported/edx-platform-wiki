# The Hacks

* This will be a great run for the big hackathon that we are working on for next November time frame!

# Why this would be useful
* Learn about parts of the codebase that we rarely touch
* Work with people we don't get to normally
* Want to get something done outside of the sprint
* Brainstorming and prototyping new features

# The Schedule
1. Oct 10, 2013: *hack*
2. Oct 11, 2013: *demo* (3:30-5pm) (Google Hangout)
