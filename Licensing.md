Licenses that are definitely compatible:

* MIT
* BSD
* Apache 2.0
* MPL 2

Licenses that are definitely not compatible:

* GPL 2
* MPL 1.1

Maybe, depends on the situation:

* AGPL (probably not; edX would not be able to relicense it)
* GPL 3 (probably not; edX would not be able to relicense it)
* LGPL (maybe, depends on usage)
