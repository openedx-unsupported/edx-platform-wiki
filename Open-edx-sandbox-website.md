Hi All - I have re-launched sandbox.edx.org, we plan to keep it online 
as a course authoring playground and for users who want to check out 
the edX open source stack without installing it from scratch. 

http://sandbox.edx.org 

By default it will be rebuilt once a week and refreshed with the 
latest version of the demo course. 
There are some dummy accounts created on the sandbox: 

honor@example.com

Each user is by default enrolled in the demo course as an honor code student. 
The password for this account is "edx".
