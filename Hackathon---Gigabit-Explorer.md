As part of a community group of mostly educators (some programmers) in Kansas City, we have been inspired to explore what Gigabit Speeds mean for online learning through the Google Fiber Build here.

On November 1 - 3 we will participate in an event called Gigabit Explorer Challenge with KC Digital Drive, US Ignite and Google Fiber.  http://us-ignite.org/gigabitexplorer/  The Hackathon will take place in Kansas City, MO at the Google Fiberspace.

We are focusing on these potential hacks:

  >  Deploy edX in Google App Engine
  >  Integrate Open Path RTC Gigabit Video into edX platform (https://mozillaignite.org/apps/438/)
  >  Implement Tin Can (xAPI) Progress Tracking Module in edX (and or) Course Builder platform (Activity - Analysis -  Mastery) https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B6YkwEpHNq9odlF4VmI3MDlnUzQ/edit
 
If you have suggestions, tips, resources, code or interest, please share!  We will be building a team in the next few weeks, and preparing for the event.
