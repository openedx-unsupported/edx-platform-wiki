The Open edX platform supports a number of use cases to enable eCommerce. The most typical use cases are:

- As an administrator of a run of a course, I would like to only allow students from enrolling in a course unless they purchase the course. 
- As an administrator of a run of a course, I would like to set up discounting via coupons
- As an administrator of a run of a course, I would also like to get some financial reporting on this course.
- As a user, I wish to enter myself into a course that has an associated price (single-seat purchase)
- As a user, I wish to enter a group of people into a course that has an associated price (multiple-seat purchase)

Note that edX.org has additional use-cases regarding the purchasing of "Verified Certifications", which will not be covered in this Documentation.
