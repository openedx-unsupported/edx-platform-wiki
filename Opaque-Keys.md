Warning: this is a WIP and discusses as-of-yet unmerged features implemented in https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/pull/2905

This document discusses the design of the Opaque Keys system, as well as the problem Opaque Keys seeks to solve. For practical understanding of how Opaque Keys impacts edX development, see [[Opaque-Keys---Developer-Notes]].

### Background

Our codebase is in the midst of a database rearchitecture. Our production database currently is referred to as "old Mongo", in preparation for the move to the new architecture known as ["split Mongo"](https://github.com/edx/edx-platform/wiki/Split:-the-versioning,-structure-saving-DAO), but currently all of our production data is stored in old Mongo. The old Mongo database uses keys that contain structured data. These Mongo keys are literally JSON objects, with key-value pairs for `tag`, `org`, `course`, `category`, `name`, and `revision`. XModule provides the `Location` class as an abstraction layer over these Mongo keys. `Location` had a serious deficiency for uniquely identifying xblocks: it does not fully specify the old-style org/course/run identifier (it leaves out the 'run'); thus, old mongo can not uniquely identify xblocks in fully qualified courses. 

Split Mongo uses the full org + course + run but also adds branch and snapshot version (like a git commit hash). The split Mongo project provides the `Locator` class as an abstraction layer over these.

### The Problem

We pass around serialized Locations and course ids throughout our codebase and allow code to parse these as they see fit. This means that we cannot add fields (such as run, branch, and version) without breaking existing code. As a result, our key abstraction breaks down: rather than merely being a pointer, our application treats these strings as data in their own right, and as a result our application contains all sorts of assumptions and expectations around what data is available, how to modify one key to create a different key, and so on.

This makes it difficult or impossible to effectively reason about how we store our data, and creates nasty ties between the data storage layer and the presentation layer.

One example of this is found in the way that LMS structures its URLs. URL construction is highly dependent on the `org/course/run` triple that is present in our keys, and those three components are parsed separately from the URL. 

This key introspection also means that different parts of our application can only accept `Location`s or only accept `Locator`s, which is odd since both types of keys refer to the same data. It means we must spend time converting from one key abstraction to another, maintaining a `loc_mapper` data structure for the sole purpose of remembering which `Location` refers to which `Locator` and vice versa -- which means lots of extra database queries and performance penalties. It also makes reasoning about how we store our data much more difficult.

## The Solution

To solve this problem, we convert these "transparent keys" (keys where the application can and does manipulate internal structure and serialized form) into "opaque keys" (keys where the application should be agnostic with respect to key format and use an api to get information about the key and construct new keys). 

The other key benefit of this solution is it allows us to migrate our data from `Location`s to `Locator`s, something we have been trying to do for quite some time. This makes it easier to reason about where and how our data is stored and accessed.

Read on for more about the architecture of OpaqueKeys. For help understanding how to utilize them in your application, see [[Opaque-Keys---Developer-Notes]].

### Key Introspection API

Because not all of our application can be easily refactored to treat keys as truly opaque, we have created a key introspection API, `opaque_keys`, that all of our database key abstractions (`Location`s and `Locator`s) support.

The purpose of this API is to allow parts of the application to indirectly introspect database keys, which (a) allows the application to get the information it needs, and (b) ensures that all requests for this information funnel through a very small number of functions. This way, if we need to change the way that the database stores its data, we can do that behind an abstraction layer, and be confident that the rest of the application won't notice. It also means that multiple database key abstractions (`Location`s and `Locators`) can support the same API, so that the rest of the application can treat them as interchangeable, in classic Python duck-typing fashion.

Note: Keys are identification information to data. It's OK to introspect keys as long as you are accessing 'identification' info.  So, for example, getting a 'course ID' from a UsageKey is alright. You are essentially asking an addressing identifier a parental context of its address, that use is supported and encouraged.

That said, it is NOT OK to be able to obtain 'data' about an object from its key.  So, for example, getting the 'number of children of that object' from a Key would not be acceptable.

## OpaqueKey Hierarchy

The base abstract Opaque Key class is implemented at `common/lib/opaque_keys/opaque_keys/__init__.py`. There are four main base abstract key classes: `CourseKey`, `DefinitionKey`, `UsageKey`, and `AssetKey`, defined within `common/lib/xmodule/xmodule/modulestore/keys.py`:

                                          OpaqueKey                                         
                    +-------------------+--------------+----------------+                    
                    |                   |              |                |                    
                    |                   |              |                |                    
                    +                   +              +                +                    
                CourseKey          DefinitonKey     UsageKey         AssetKey                
            +--------------+       +----------+    +----------+       +------+               â€‰
            |              |       |          +-++-+          |              |                
            +              +       +            ++            +              +                
    SlashSeparated     Course    Definition   Location        BlockUsage     AssetLocation    
      CourseKey         Locator     Locator                      Locator                      
                                                                                        
                                                                 
`CourseKey`s identify courses. A `SlashSeparatedCourseKey` is the course key used for old style `org/course/run` identifiers; a `CourseLocator` is a course key that supports the new style `org+offering` identifier that provides more flexibility in naming conventions.

A `DefinitionKey` is a type of `OpaqueKey` that will be used to identify an XBlock's reusable content.

A `UsageKey` identifies an XBlock usage in a particular context (usually a course). `Location`s and `BlockUsageLocator`s are examples.

A `Location` is both a `DefinitionKey` and a `UsageKey`. `Location`s identify a particular module within a course; they also know about the module's XBlock scope.

An `AssetKey` supports static assets such as pictures, pdfs, and mp3s uploaded by course authors through Studio.

The classes `SlashSeparatedCourseKey` and `Location` both have the `to_deprecated_string` method and `from_deprecated_string` classmethod. This method enables users to serialize and deserialize the CourseKey in the old-style "org/course/run" format and the `Location` in the `i4x://org/course/category/id` format.

### Utilizing Keys

Eventually, no application or interface should specify the type of key needed, only the abstract class (UsageKey, AssetKey,  CourseKey are good, Location and others are bad).

Requiring a Location is a temporary short cut due to LMS not truly treating keys as opaque. We are migrating to a world of true opaqueness, where only the persistence layer (modulestore) should control the concrete key class. Do not write new code that depends on specific types of keys.

### Key Relationships

Keys are related in the following way:
                                                                                        
                          CourseKey        DefKey                                             
                          ^       ^                                                     
                          |       |                                                     
                          v       v                                                     
                    AssetKey     UsageKey                                               

A `CourseKey` knows about its `AssetKey`s and `UsageKey`s. An `AssetKey` and a `UsageKey` each knows which `CourseKey` it is associated with. DefKey's are context independent.

### URLs

We want to have meaningful URLs where possible, which means using slugs instead of numerical IDs or GUIDs. The simple resolution for this is to serialize and deserialize these opaque keys in such a way that the information is not obscured; for example, most `CourseKey`s serialize as `org+course+run` plus possibly other information such as branch and version snapshot id.


## Completed and Ongoing Work

Completing the full transition to OpaqueKeys will comprise several steps, some of which can be executed concurrently.

1. *Pass Location and course_id together throughout applications (LMS) or use the new Location serialization which includes the run* Currently, there are many functions in our codebase that only take a Location or only take a course_id; this is not enough information to uniquely identify a single record in the database, and so we frequently try to look up one from the other. We need to modify our code to always pass Location and course_id together, even if only one or the other is used; this will make it possible for us to replace Location and course_id with Locator.
Part of this phase is changing Studio's urls once again but this time to the opaque urls. So, an existing url of `https://studio.stage-edge.edx.org/course/test.99.test_import/branch/draft/block/test_import` will become `https://studio.stage-edge.edx.org/course/location:test+99+test_import+course+test_import`. That is, `/org.course.cat.num.run/branch/draft/block/block.id` will become `/location:org+course.cat.num+run+xblock_type+block.id`

2. *Convert URLs to use opaque keys (done in Studio, needs to be completed in LMS).* Before, our URLs were defined using different pieces of information from Location in different parts of the URL. For example, `/courses/org/course/name/gradebook`. We need to change these URLs so that the information can be parsed in one segment using a regular expression, something like `slashes:org+course+run/gradebook`. In Studio, we had URLs that had a serialized Locator, such as `/assets/org.course.name/branch-name/asset_id` -- we have leveraged opaque keys such that a url, for example, an asset handler, looks like this: `assets/slashes:edx+101+2014/asset-location:edx+101+2014+asset+file_name.ext`.
4. *Prepare our SQL databases to refer to the new serialized format.* Our SQL databases have some records that contain serialized Locations. We need to create a table in our SQL database that will map old Locations to new Locators, and prepare our queries to join on this table as necessary.
5. *Switch from Locations to Locators.* Because our application will be using opaque keys, the application layer won't be able to tell the difference. This will allow us to remove the course_id being passed everywhere through our application; a Locator contains all the information in both the Location and the course_id, so only one is necessary. This is the reason why we originally had to refactor our application to pass Location and course_id around together; so that we could ensure that we could replace the two of them with one Locator everywhere. Note that for Studio, this will have to be done in such a way that there is a switch that controls whether it writes data in the old Location format or the new Locator format.
6. *Check performance, optimize indexes.* Undoubtedly, there will be performance implications in the new data format. We'll be able to estimate these performance implications in preparing for the migration, but there are always unknowns. If there are extreme problems, we can rollback to the old data.
