The people who work for edX are divided up into several teams, and each one has a corresponding Github team that makes it [easier to mention them all at once](https://github.com/blog/1121-introducing-team-mentions). The teams are:

* **@edx/team-studio**: responsible for the Studio product, used to build courses.
* **@edx/team-lms**: responsible for the LMS product ("Learning Management System"), used to take courses.
* **@edx/team-analytics**: responsible for productizing the data gathered by edX, used by learning researchers.
* **@edx/team-ux**: responsible for the User Experience, including design and understandable functionality.
* **@edx/team-testeng**: responsible for making sure our code has tests, measuring test coverage, building test frameworks, and supporting test infrastructure.
* **@edx/team-doc**: responsible for writing and maintaining our documentation and the documentation intrastructure.
* **@edx/team-ora**: responsible for developing and supporting the Open Response Assessment framework.
* **@edx/team-forums**: responsible for developing and supporting the forums software.
* **@edx/team-devops**: responsible for developing and supporting the deployment scripts, and everything related to keeping the website up and running.
* **@edx/team-escalation**: responsible for fixing high-priority bugs that affect edx.org
* **@edx/team-blades**: responsible for developing and supporting components that cut across many layers in the tech stack.
